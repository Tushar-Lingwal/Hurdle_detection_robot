# Hurdle_detection_robot
This is my mini project on hurdle detection robot for my college. 
the project consist of car module mounted with ultrasonic sencor that detect the upcomming hurdle and send the distance value form the hurdle back to the micro-controller Arduino UNO, the controller will the decide the direction to turn the car in order to avoid the hurdel in front of it.

the components used for the robot are as followed:
1. Arduino UNO
2. l298d motor driver shield ( for arduino uno)
3. ultrasonic sensor
4. servo
5. car body ( chassis )
6. junper cables (male to male and male to female)
7. 3.7v x 3 lithium ion battery set( 11.7v total)
